## Introduction

The JST PH Series is one of the most popular wire-to-board connector systems in the electronics industry. With its compact 2.0mm pitch and reliable friction-lock mechanism, it has become the go-to choice for high-density PCB applications in consumer electronics, IoT devices, and portable equipment.

## Key Specifications

### Electrical Ratings
- **Voltage Rating**: 100V AC/DC
- **Current Rating**: 2A per pin
- **Contact Resistance**: 20mΩ maximum
- **Insulation Resistance**: 1000MΩ minimum
- **Dielectric Withstanding Voltage**: 500V AC for 1 minute

### Mechanical Specifications
- **Pitch**: 2.0mm
- **Number of Positions**: 2 to 15 circuits
- **Housing Material**: PA66 (Polyamide 66) with glass fiber
- **Flame Rating**: UL94V-0
- **Operating Temperature**: -25°C to +85°C
- **Mating Cycles**: 30 minimum

## Connector Types

### 1. Receptacle Housings
The wire-side receptacle accepts crimp terminals and features a friction-lock design that ensures secure connection without additional locking mechanisms.

### 2. PCB Headers
Available in both through-hole and surface mount configurations, these headers mate with receptacle housings to create complete wire-to-board connections.

### 3. Crimp Terminals
Tin-plated copper terminals designed for 28-24 AWG wire gauges. Proper crimp tooling is essential for reliable connections.

## Applications

### Consumer Electronics
- Smartphones and tablets
- Wearable devices
- Portable audio equipment
- Smart home devices

### Computer Peripherals
- Internal PCB connections
- Power delivery within devices
- Signal routing between boards

### Automotive Electronics
- Dashboard modules
- Sensor connections
- Infotainment systems

### Industrial Control
- PLC I/O connections
- Sensor interfaces
- Control board interconnects

## Wiring Best Practices

### 1. Crimping Process
1. Strip wire to appropriate length (typically 2-3mm)
2. Insert wire into terminal
3. Crimp using proper tool (JST part number: YRS-01 or equivalent)
4. Perform pull test to verify crimp quality

### 2. Terminal Insertion
1. Orient terminal correctly (check for locking tang)
2. Push terminal into housing until it clicks
3. Tug gently to confirm proper locking
4. Use extraction tool for removal if needed

### 3. PCB Layout Guidelines
- Follow recommended footprint dimensions
- Ensure proper clearance for mating
- Consider keep-out areas for connector body
- Test with actual connector before production

## Compatible Alternatives

While genuine JST connectors are excellent, cost-effective alternatives are available:

- **HARNESS+LAB SFR Series**: Direct JST PH compatible
- **Major Brand Equivalents**: Various manufacturers offer PH-compatible options
- **Key Consideration**: Always verify dimensional and electrical compatibility

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Poor Contact Resistance
**Solution**: Verify crimp quality, check for proper terminal insertion, ensure clean contacts

### Issue: Difficulty Inserting Terminals
**Solution**: Check terminal orientation, verify correct terminal for housing, use proper insertion tool

### Issue: Intermittent Connections
**Solution**: Inspect for damaged terminals, verify proper mating force, check for contamination

## Design for Manufacturability Tips

1. **Standardize on Common Position Counts**: 2, 4, and 8 positions are most readily available
2. **Consider Assembly**: More positions mean longer assembly time
3. **Plan for Testing**: Include test points for electrical verification
4. **Document Clearly**: Specify exact part numbers in BOM

## Conclusion

The JST PH Series offers an excellent balance of size, reliability, and cost for wire-to-board connections. Understanding the specifications, proper assembly techniques, and application requirements will help ensure success in your wire harness projects.
